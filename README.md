Module 22 Challenge
## Context
This challenge leverages SparkSQL to explore a large real estate dataset.<br>
The second part of the challenge (parquet) did not run on my computer. I switched then to Google Colab to run the code. Consequently, the runtime is significantly slower than on my computer and the differences between the runtimes become less pronounced. The parquet runtime was marginally slower than the initial spark runtime. The cache runtime was faster by about 25%.
